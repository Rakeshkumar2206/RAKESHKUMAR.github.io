Hey There! This is my website where,<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You can see all the specifics about me, over here.</p>
<p>Hi, Myself Rakesh Kumar </p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> A noob in securing anything made with Silicon and Gallium-Arsenide compounds and algorithms, but I have a high density knowledge over computer-hardware and Information security auditing, yeah IKR sounds vague like jumping from one branch to another branch. Trust me I'm a bit good at it. I did my under graduate in B.A Criminology and Police Administration {WORST DEGREE EVER} and pursued my masters in MCA with Information Security. 
<p> My passion is to work in the Information security and privacy related domain and I also love to build computers, I have built more than baker's dozen of them till date and will try to build more.
<p> My hobbies are gaming (Conole or PC Games) Mobile Gamers are Chutiya's TBH, exploring food, building mech keyboards, computers and fapping for Gina Valentina, Reagan Foxx and Casca Akashova {Love her Lipo Suction tho}.
<p> I collect diecast cars {Toy Cars} of 1:64 from manufactures like Kyosho, MiniGT, Maisto, Hotwheels and Majorette and some Classic Thinkpads too and currently I own a X60, X60i, T40, X220i, X250, T450 and X1 Carbon 7th Gen.
<p>Relation ship status is currently Cohabitant and would love to maintain that for a few more years. <br><br><br>You can view my grizzly printed face at Instagram. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rakesh_kumar_rajasekar/?hl=en"> Here you go!</a></p><!-- Instagram ID -->
